4.So we create a book,next we should connect with Github to realize collaborative function.We get into the book,click "settings",then copy the book address in the following picture,this address is used to pass the URL of this book to a repository in Github.

5.Go to the [https://github.com/new/import](https://github.com/new/import),then put the address to the Url box,and create a Github repository.So that Github can synchronize with Gitbook through this address.

8.However,we have to give Gitbook the Github address.So we get back to Gitbook,add the repository for Github，it is "test_repository" we create at the fifth step.This completes the two-way communication between Gitbook and Github.

9.(This step is optional )This completes the association of gitbook and github,using gitbook to write a book is enough,so why connect it with github?This is because github can be collaborative,for example,one book can be written by many writers,xiaohui is writing the book,and at the same time,xiaoqiang is writing as well.So github can know when and where who change the book,and change where.What's more,github can set permissions,for example,xiaohui is the creater and owner of the book,he wants to invite xiaoqiang to edit the book,so he can give the permission to xiaoqiang,then xiaoqiang have the authority to write this book.As following:

Each repository can set collaborators：

10.After building the connection between github and gitbook,we can edit the book quietly.First,we need to download the Gitbook client,markdown editing in the client is both convenient and fast.We  download the "test_repository" to local，edit and then upload,the download is as shown below:

11.After getting into the book,we can edit：

13.After uploading,we can open gitbook and github in the website，and find that there are some changes both in github and gitbook,so we can edit the book in Gitbook client and then display them in the website.

**Now we have built the connection between Github and Gitbook,then we can edit books through gitbook,and we can also update them to github,this is very convenient.**
