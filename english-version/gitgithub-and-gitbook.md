###1.Git、Github

**Git is a kind of version controller tool，Github is an open source platform that can storage your own project**.

• You have the plan A，and after discussion you change to B.Some hours later,you still feel the plan A is better,but at that time,you forgot to save it,so you need to change it throuth your memory.But in Github you don't need to worry,because it can record each version and put them into the repository,every change is one commit,so you can rollback to any version. 

• In addition you are likely to encounter the case of the derivative of the project.On the basis of scheme A，you change it to B or C，and sometimes B1、B2 or C1、C2,so the braches in github can record the procedure of this differentiation.


• Later, you think the B1 and C2 programs are desirable,they can be integrated into the finalized,of course,Git can also support this branch merge.
